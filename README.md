This app is a combination between a wikia and a forum. On the wikia people can find Pokémon related information and on the forum people can discuss Pokémon related topics. People can also play the Pokémon Naming Challenge in this app.

On the Wikia people can either search for a Pokémon, ability or type or select a Pokémon from a list. This will take them to more information about that thing. For Pokémon they can see a sprite, base stats, types and abilities. For abilities they can see a description, the effect, what generation it was introduced and a list of Pokémon with the ability. For types they can see type-effectiveness and a list of Pokémon with the type.

On the forum people can see a list of all topics and click on them to see the posts in the topics. They can then also create their own topic or post a new comment.

The goal of the Naming Challenge is to type out the names of all 807 Pokémon. In this implementation, progress is saved so someone doesn't have to complete it in one go. There are also options to give up and see the full list of Pokémon or to restart, which resets the progress.
